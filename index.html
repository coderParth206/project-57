                <p> I love swimming but I can not do it much anymore because of coronavirus. I used to be on the swim team for pjcc. It took me 2 years to pass every level before I got there. I really enjoy swimming  and I have developed an interest for it as I learned swimming. Now it is one of my favorite sports. I hope after the virus I can continue to swim in swim team.</p>
